# Winshell

My attempt at a shell/ux replacement for windows... IN VB!!
May provide a windows 10-esqe ux to older windows versions.

## What's New:

### The app now follows the System Accent Color.
### Fluent-like blurring behind the app.
### Can now pin and unpin tiles.
### Minor UI Tweaks
Bugfixes, 
Some experimental Fatures added. to enable them, you need to change the flags accordingly in WinShell.exe.config
